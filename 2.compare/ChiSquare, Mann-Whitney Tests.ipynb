The occurrence of words are not independent random events; they are tightly coupled with each other. If we're trying to understanding the robust differences between two corpora, we might prefer to prioritize words that show up more frequently everywhere in corpus A (but not in corpus B) over those that show up only very frequently within narrow slice of A (such as one text in a genre, one chapter in a book, or one speaker when measuring the differences between policital parties).
