EVENING

The light passes 
from ridge to ridge, 
from flower to flower -  
the hypaticas, wide-spread 
under the light 
grow faint -  
the petals reach inward, 
the blue tips bend 
toward the bluer heart 
and the flowers are lost.
     
The cornel-buds are still white,
but shadows dart
from the cornel-roots - 
black creeps from root to root,
each leaf
cuts another leaf on the grass,
shadow seeks shadow,
then both leaf
and leaf-shadow are lost.
