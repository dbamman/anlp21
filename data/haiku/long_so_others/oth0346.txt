SONGS TO JOANNES

		I
Spawn of Fantasies
Silting the appraisable
Pig Cupid his rosy snout
Rooting erotic garbage
"Once upon a time"
Pulls a weed white and star-topped
Among wild oats sewn in mucous-membrane

I would an eye in a bengal light
Eternity in a sky-rocket
Constellations in an ocean
Whose rivers run no fresher 
Than a trickle of saliva

These are suspect places

I must live in my lantern 
Trimming subliminal flicker 
Virginal to the bellows 
Of Experience
		Coloured glass

			II
		The skin-sack 
In which a wanton duality 
Packed
All the completions of my infructuous impulses 
Something the shape of a man
To the casual vulgarity of the merely observant 
More of a clock-work mechanism 
Running down against time 
To which I am not paced
	My finger-tips are numb from fretting your hair 
A God's door-mat
		On the threshold of your mind

			III
We might have coupled
In the bed-ridden monopoly of a moment
Or broken flesh with one another
At the profane communion table
Where wine is spill't on promiscuous lips

We might have given birth to a butterfly 
With the daily-news 
Printed in blood on its wings

			IV
Once in a mezzanino
The starry ceiling
Vaulted an unimaginable family
Bird-like abortions
With human throats
And Wisdom's eyes
Who wore lamp-shade red dresses
And woolen hair
One bore a baby 
In a padded porte-enfant 
Tied with a sarsanet ribbon 
To her goose's wings

But for the abominable shadows
I would have lived
Among their fearful furniture
To teach them to tell me their secrets
Before I guessed
- Sweeping the brood clean out

			V
Midnight empties the street
Of all but us
Three
I am undecided which way back
		To the left a boy
- One wing has been washed in the rain
	The other will never be clean any more‚Äî
Pulling door-bells to remind
Those that are snug
		To the right a haloed ascetic
		Threading houses 
Probes wounds for souls ‚
- The poor can't wash in hot water - 
And I dont know which turning to take 
Since you got home to yourself - first

			VI
I know the Wire-Puller intimately 
And if it were not for the people 
On whom you keep one eye 
You could look straight at me 
And Time would be set back

			VII
My pair of feet 
Smack the flag-stones
That are something left over from your walking
The wind stuffs the scum of the white street
Into my lungs and my nostrils
Exhilarated birds
Prolonging flight into the night
Never reaching - - - - - - -

			VIII

I am the jealous store-house of the candle-ends 
That lit your adolescent learning

- - - - - - - - - - 

Behind God's eyes 
There might 
Be other lights

			IX

When we lifted 
Our eye-lids on Love 
A cosmos 
Of coloured voices 
And laughing honey

And spermatazoa
At the core of Nothing
In the milk of the Moon

			X
Shuttle-cock and battle-door
A little pink-love
And feathers are strewn

			XI

Dear one at your mercy 
Our Universe 
Is only
A colorless onion 
You derobe 
Sheath by sheath
	Remaining 
A disheartening odour 
About your nervy hands

			XII
Voices break on the confines of passion 
Desire Suspicion Man Woman 
Solve in the humid carnage

Flesh from flesh
Draws the inseparable delight
Kissing at gasps to catch it

Is it true
That I have set you apart 
Inviolate in an utter crystallization 
Of all the jolting of the crowd 
Taught me willingly to live to share

Or are you
Only the other half
Of an ego's necessity
Scourging pride with compassion
To the shallow sound of dissonance
And boom of escaping breath

			XIII

Come to me There is something
I have got to tell you and I can't tell
Something taking shape
Something that has a new name
A new dimension
A new use
A new illusion

It is ambient	And it is in your eyes 
Something shiny	Something only for you
		Something that I must not see

It is in my ears	Something very resonant 
Something that you must not hear
		Something only for me

Let us be very jealous 
Very suspicious 
Very conservative 
Very cruel
Or we might make an end of the jostling of aspira-
	tions
Disorb inviolate egos

Where two or three are welded together 
They shall become god
- - - - - - - 
Oh that's right
Keep away from me Please give me a push 
Don't let me understand you Don't realise me
Or we might tumble together
Depersonalized
Identical
Into the terrific Nirvana 
Me you - you - me

			XIV
Today
Everlasting passing apparent imperceptible 
To you
I bring the nascent virginity of 
- Myself for the moment

No love or the other thing 
Only the impact of lighted bodies 
Knocking sparks off each other 
In chaos

			XV

Seldom Trying for Love 
Fantasy dealt them out as gods 
Two or three men looked only human

But you alone
Superhuman apparently
I had to be caught in the weak eddy
Of your drivelling humanity
	To love you most

			XVI
We might have lived together
In the lights of the Arno
Or gone apple stealing under the sea
Or played
Hide and seek in love and cob-webs 
And a lullaby on a tin-pan

And talked till there were no more tongues 
To talk with
And never have known any better

			XVII
I don't care
Where the legs of the legs of the furniture are walk-
	ing to
Or what is hidden in the shadows they stride 
Or what would look at me 
If the shutters were not shut

Red a warm colour on the battle-field 
Heavy on my knees as a counterpane 
Count counter
I counted the fringe of the towel 
Till two tassels clinging together 
Let the square room fall away 
From a round vacuum 
Dilating with my breath

			XVIII
Out of the severing 
Of hill from hill
The interim
Of star from star
The nascent
Static
Of night

			XIX
Nothing so conserving 
As cool cleaving 
Note of the Q H U 
Clear carving 
Breath-giving 
Pollen smelling 
Space

White telling 
Of slaking 
Drinkable 
Through fingers 
Running water 
Grass haulms 
Grow to

Leading astray
Of fireflies 
Aerial quadrille
Bouncing
Off one another
Again conjoining
In recaptured pulses
Of light
You too
Had something
At that time
Of a green-lit glow-worm
- - - - - - -
Yet slowly drenched 
To raylessness 
In rain

			XX

Let Joy go solace-winged
To flutter whom she may concern

			XXI

I store up nights against you 
Heavy with shut-flower's nightmares
- - - - - - - - - -
Stack noons
Curled to the solitaire
Core of the
Sun

			XXII
Green things grow 
Salads
For the cerebral 
Forager's revival
Upon bossed bellies 
Of mountains 
Rolling in the sun 
And flowered flummery 
Breaks
To my silly shoes

In ways without you 
I go
Gracelessly 
As things go

			XXIII
Laughter in solution
Stars in a stare
Irredeemable pledges
Of pubescent consummations
Rot
To the recurrent moon 
Bleach
To the pure white 
Wickedness of pain

			XXIV
The procreative truth of Me 
Petered out 
In pestilent 
Tear drops
Little lusts and lucidities 
And prayerful lies
Muddled with the heinous acerbity 
Of your street-corner smile

			XXV
Licking the Arno
The little rosy
Tongue of Dawn
Interferes with our eyelashes
- - - - - - - -
We twiddle to it 
Round and round 
Faster
And turn into machines

Till the sun
Subsides in shining
Melts some of us
Into abysmal pigeon-holes
Passion has bored
In warmth

Some few of us
Grow to the level of cool plains
Cutting our foot-hold 
With steel eyes

			XXVI

Shedding our petty pruderies 
From slit eyes
We sidle up 
To Nature
- - - that irate pornographist

			XXVII
Nucleus Nothing 
Inconceivable concept 
Insentient repose 
The hands of races
Drop off from 
Immodifiable plastic

The contents
Of our ephemeral conjunction
In aloofness from Much
Flowed to approachment of - - - - 
NOTHING
There was a man and a woman 
In the way
While the Irresolvable 
Rubbed with our daily deaths 
Impossible eyes

			XXVIII
The steps go up for ever
And they are white
And the first step is the last white
Forever
Coloured conclusions
Smelt to synthetic 
Whiteness
Of my
Emergence
And I am burnt quite white 
In the climacteric 
Withdrawal of your sun 
And wills and words all white 
Suffuse
Illimitable monotone

White where there is nothing to see
But a white towel
Wipes the cymophonous sweat
- Mist rise of living - 
From your
Etiolate body
And the white dawn
Of your New Day
Shuts down on me

Unthinkable that white over there 
- - - Is smoke from your house

			XXIX
Evolution fall foul of 
Sexual equality 
Prettily miscalculate 
Similitude
Unnatural selection 
Breed such sons and daughters 
As shall jibber at each other 
Uninterpretable cryptonyms 
Under the moon

Give them some way of braying brassily
For carressive calling
Or to homophonous hiccoughs
Transpose the laugh
Let them suppose that tears
Are snowdrops or molasses
Or anything
Than human insufficiencies 
Begging dorsal vertebrae

Let meeting be the turning
To the antipodean
And Form a blurr
Anything
Than seduce them
To the one
As simple satisfaction 
For the other

Let them clash together 
From their incognitoes 
In seismic orgasm
For far further 
Differentiation 
Rather than watch 
Own-self distortion 
Wince in the alien ego

			XXX
In some
Prenatal plagiarism 
Foetal buffoons 
Caught tricks
- - - - -

From architypal pantomime 
Stringing emotions
Looped aloft
- - - -

For the blind eyes
That Nature knows us with
And the most of Nature is green
- - - - - - - - - -

What guaranty 
For the proto-form 
We fumble
Our souvenir ethics to
- - - - - - -

			XXXI
Crucifixion 
Of a busy-body
Longing to interfere so
With the intimacies
Of your insolent isolation

Crucifixion
Of an illegal ego's
Eclosion
On your equilibrium 
Caryatid of an idea

Crucifixion 
Wracked arms 
Index extremities 
In vacuum 
To the unbroken fall

			XXXII
The moon is cold 
Joannes
Where the Mediterranean - - - - -

			XXXIII
The prig of passion - - - - 
To your professorial paucity

Proto-plasm was raving mad 
Evolving us - - - 

			XXXIV

Love - - - the preeminent literateur
